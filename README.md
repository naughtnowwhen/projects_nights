!!! wow Jackie's javascript connect came up with something really cool!
/Users/petermurphy/Desktop/Slack\:code\ holder/image_from_ios.jpg
in the terminal it can be found in nights201/imgCatchall


looked up in browser...
AskerFunction(countries[0]), it returned "im prompting" app.js:68


// an example of what the first small object in the bigObject may look like
firstPossibleSmallObjXxample = {
countries : countries[0],
CorrectAnswer : correctCounter[0]
boolCorrect = false;
userGuess = prompt('whatever the user puts in for an answer, either yes or no),


var x = 'access to a method that can check if userGuess === CorrectAnswer and if it doesset boolCorrect to equal true.';

}


// A second example 

secondPossibleExampleSmallObjExample = {
countries : countries,
CorrectAnswer : correctAnswer;
//  boolCorrect : an array of all the boolCorrects that have accumulated each time the user guesses correctly;

// if could be a function that returns the boolCorrect at index[i]

// correctCounter: could be a function that accumulates each time a bool is set true, or an array that gets pushed into when true,
}


now that it's working, i should start a new clean branch that just takes what is working, it should also probably be a new or different repo
